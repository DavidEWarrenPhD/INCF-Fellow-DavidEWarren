### Audience

* This workshop is intended for an audience of UN graduate students and
  post-docs who are interested in learning more about principles of
  reproducible neuroimaging.
* We assume that all attendees will be (cognitive) neuroscientists having some
  experience with data collection and analysis in a neuroimaging modality.
* We will not assume any expertise with UNIX-like computing environments,
  version control, or specific approaches to data processing or analysis.

### Format

* The format of this workshop will be **two one-day lessons** focused on
  communicating the principles of reproducible neuroimaging with some
  emphasis on skills and implementation.
   * Day 1: Reproducibility intro and some basics (w/homework to complete
     remaining basics) using Binder/JupyterHub on UN HPC resources
   * Intermission: Homework and additional reading
   * Day 2: Data processing of introductory dataset using Binder/JupyterHub
* NOTE: Binder/JupyterHub instances should remain available between and after
  workshop sessions

### Material

* Overview: Material to be covered will include elements of the intro, basics, and
  dataprocessing modules.
