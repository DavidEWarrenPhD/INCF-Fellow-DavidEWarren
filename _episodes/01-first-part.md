### Audience

* This workshop is intended for an audience of graduate students and
  post-docs who are interested in learning more about principles of
  reproducible neuroimaging.
* We assume that all attendees will be (cognitive) neuroscientists having some
  experience with data collection and analysis in a neuroimaging modality.
* We will not assume any expertise with UNIX-like computing environments,
  version control, or specific approaches to data processing or analysis.

### Format

* The format of this workshop will be **two half-day lessons** focused on
  communicating the principles of reproducible neuroimaging with some
  emphasis on skills and implementation.
   * Day 1: Reproducibility intro and some basics (w/homework to complete
     remaining basics) using Binder/JupyterHub on UN HPC resources
   * Intermission: Homework and additional reading
   * Day 2: Data processing of introductory dataset using Binder/JupyterHub
* NOTE: Binder/JupyterHub instances should remain available between and after
  workshop sessions

### Material

* Material to be covered will include elements of the intro, basics, and
  dataprocessing modules.
* Day 1
   * Introduction (30 min.)
      * All material (streamlined for target group)
   * Reproducibility Basics (180 min.)
      * NOTE: Each lesson will be streamlined for introduction of concepts and
        basic examples only
      * Lesson 1: Command line/shell
      * (BREAK)
      * Lesson 2: Version control systems
      * Lesson 3: Package managers and distributions
      * Lesson 4: Other day-to-day reproducible practices
* Intermission (Homework: 2-week break)
* Day 2
   * Data Processing (200 min.)
      * NOTE: Each lesson will be streamlined to briefly introduce concepts and
        provide basic workflow examples only
      * Lesson 1: Core concepts using an analysis example
      * Lesson 2: Annotate, harmonize, clean, and version data
      * (BREAK)
      * Lesson 3: Create and maintain reproducible computational environments
      * Lesson 4: Create reusable and composable dataflow tools
