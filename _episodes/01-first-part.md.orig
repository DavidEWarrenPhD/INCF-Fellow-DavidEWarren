### Audience

* This workshop is intended for an audience of graduate students and
  post-docs who are interested in learning more about principles of
  reproducible neuroimaging.

### Format

* The format of this workshop will be two half-day lessons focused on
  communicating the principles of reproducible neuroimaging with a lesser
  emphasis on implementation.

### Material

* Material to be covered will include elements of the intro, basics, and
  dataprocessing modules.

### Markdown format allows you to create nice web-pages

And with only a really small amount of effort! It's text based, so you can
write exactly what you intend to say.

If you want to introduce a block of code into your lesson, write a block
fenced by triple-tilde. Here is an example of that

~~~
import nibabel as nib
img = nib.load('my_file.nii.gz')
affine = img.affine
~~~
{: .python}


Images can be embedded into the lesson plan, by using the following syntax:

![an image]({{site.root}}/fig/rn-logo.png)

To embed images, you will also want to copy the image file into the
`fig` folder of the repository, and add that.

>
>  Boxes with "challenges" can be interleaved with the lesson materials.
>  Consider adding a challenge every 15 minutes or so.
>    - This helps participants stay engaged.
>    - It surfaces questions that learners have as they go along.
>    - It breaks up the instruction, providing a bit of a diversion.
>    - It gives people a chance to engage in peer instruction, which is
>      is [known to help learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_instruction).
{: .challenge}


> ## Callouts
> If you want to introduce a box with a "callout", use this syntax
> This is useful for materials that you think of as explanatory asides
> I usually use this for extra material that is "optional".
{: .callout}
